# RTL-SDR-ADS-B-Tracking-System
In this research, the ADS-B data is obtained using a low cost RTL-SDR radio known as R820T RTL2832U and a Raspberry Pi-3B Single-Board Computer. The data is recorded in the Raspberry Pi-3B (which is the ADS-B receiver) and is rendered and visualized with the help of a selfwritten code. Following this, data is captured and analysed for the city Bangalore, India to determine all the aircraft travelling within the bounds of fifteen unique ATS routes, derived the airports where the aircraft are bound to land and the runway direction of the airport.  I worked on the project for 6 months and the report was co-authored by me.  My co-authors later wrote the findings into an IEEE paper which is present in this repository.
